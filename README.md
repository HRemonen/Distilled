## Stacx

The Distillery Application is built using the following technologies:

- **Backend Magic**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQL
- **Frontend Wizardry**: React, React Query, Tailwind Css
- **Database Enchantment**: PostgreSQL
- **Mapping Mayhem**: Mapbox API
- **Authentication Sorcery**: JWT
- **Validation Anarchy**: Zod, Marshmallow
- **Environment**: Docker, docker compose

## Development

Replace [the template env file](server/env.template) with a .env file with your setup.

Launch the app in development mode by running `docker-compose up --build` in the root folder.

This will start the frontend, backend and db in their own containers.

### View database in development

You can view database tables and interact with the database with

```bash
docker exec -it distillery-db psql distillery-db -U postgres -W
```

If you have changes the docker-compose.yml and your database strings in .env file the command will be in form

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> psql <DB_NAME> -U <DB_USER> -W
```

You will be prompted the DB_PASSWORD when using this command

### Installing new packages

Now the docker compose volumes are configured so that the client node_modules are not shared with local and container space.

This is because of development in ARM chips causes some packages to be transpiled as non compatible for Linux systems or whatever so the container can not run the application.

If you are developing using Linux you could change the [docker-compose.yml]() app services volumes to

```yml
volumes:
  - ./src/client:/usr/src/app
  - ./src/client/node_modules:/usr/src/app/node_modules
```

This way the node_modules are shared across the container and local.

Otherwise you must rebuild the image after new package installations

### Closing the application

Close the application with

```bash
docker compose down
```
